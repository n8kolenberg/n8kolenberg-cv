            <h3>Welcome to my online CV! This is an overview of my work experience, my goals and passions and of course, how to get in touch with me</h3>

            <h4>Profile Summary</h4>
            <p>Throughout my career journey, I have become fascinated with how the web works and in early 2014 I started taking courses at Amazon, on Treehouse (teemtreehouse.com), and on Udacity (udacity.com) to learn more. At the start of 2015, I've decided to take a step further, to consolidate the self-taught knowledge and get hands-on experience through means of a mentor, with the goal of becoming a Front End Web Developer. To that end, I'm in the final stage of completing the <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/courses/learn-web-development-online/" target="_blank">Thinkful Front End Web Development Course </a> and building out my portfolio.</p>

            <p>Next up, an overview of my technical skills.</p>
